# AES-GCM-SIV Library

## Overview

AES-GCM-SIV is an authenticated encryption algorithm designed to provide nonce misuse resistance, and is specified in [RFC 8452](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8452).

This repository provides C, Android, and Java implementations, and is optimized for high-performance in architectures with cryptographic hardware accelerators.

## Getting started

### C

The C implementation of AES-GCM-SIV provides the core functionality of the library, and is located in the [`lib`](./lib) repository.
It is optimized for high-performance encryption and decryption in specific CPU architecture.

Detailed instructions are available in this [`README.md`](./lib/README.md).

### Android

The Android implementation is done with a JNI (Java Native Interface) wrapper over the C implementation.
This allows to take advantage of the optimized C code when it is supported by the runtime architecture.
The JNI bindings are in the [`jni`](./jni) repository, and the Android code is located in the [`android`](./android) repository.

Detailed instructions are available in this [`README.md`](./android/README.md).

### Java

The Java implementation is done with a JNI (Java Native Interface) wrapper over the C implementation.
This allows to take advantage of the optimized C code when it is supported by the runtime architecture.
The JNI bindings are in the [`jni`](./jni) repository, and the Java code is located in the [`java`](./java) repository.

Detailed instructions are available in this [`README.md`](./java/README.md).
